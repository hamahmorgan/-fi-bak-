alright here we go - this lil blog is a reaction to the trying, surviving, and thriving in an Atlantic Canadian art world that is so much more than the sum of its parts. rural resistance, despite demanding institutional malaise, that rejects romanticized regergatations of cultural extraction and exploitation.  

cheers to political sell outs; those glitter clad mermaids choking on the white plastic cock-ring of capitalism. i won’t be apologizing for that salty taste left in your mouth once you catch your breath. 

maggoty streets filled with cruise ship tourism and nautical wet dreams of quaint coastal shores. fuck u n’ plz stop. 

my briny ocean sauce comes from an upbringing encrusted with colonial history, patriarchal traumas and a socio-economic class that should have never felt capable to write a critical art blog. O and that one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollar student loan that paid for my superiors’ scholarships and grade bumps.  ya, it in particular has made this journey especially fraught with self hate and desperate positioning. 


the hope is that I this is a place of refuge for those who are exhausted from the hurt and anger. that you can pull strength from knowing you are valid in your experiences and the feelings that result. that those who uphold these harmful structures are wrong and should be held accountable for their negligence. Negligence in the positions publicly funded with the intention that they serve the community. Private ambition is not acceptable in these positions of public service. Corporate structures are exploitive and toxic with the systems in place that produced harmful colonial propaganda - resulting in the genocide of many people and their entire ways of life.
